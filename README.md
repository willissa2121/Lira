#User Install
##For an increased user experience, the development team would highly recommend that the user clone this repository. It is much easier to follow along with the images while using Visual studio code.


####How to use LIRA_BOT

#For this Homework, the goal is to take in user input to select which API will be called, and then to take another user-input to execute the search query within the appropriate API call. For this LIRA-BOT, 3 API calls are made. The user can choose 1 of 4 options on the original menu that appears when node is initaited (screenshot 22). If the user selects Movie Search, a blank input will be displayed where the user can enter the movie title they wish to search (screenshot 23). After pressing enter, the API is sent using the inut as the movei Query search. The results will be displayed as appropriate strings (screenshot 24). If the user selects song search, they will be prompted to enter a song name, which will return several details on the song, using he spotify API (screenshot 20,21 and 25). If the user chooses event search, they will be prompted to enter a band name, which will the parse itself into the search query and return detals on the bands next concert (screenshot 26). If the user chooses random call, the LIRA-BOT will execute the movie-call API on the content of the file.txt. In this case, the file.txt contains two works that say "Space Jam", which is then added to the search query and returned the same as the previous movie search (screenshot 28). The user will always be taken to the main menu (screenshot 22), when node is initated.


## Update 
# Now with functioning Email! Username and password are both protected in a .env file. Using Nodemail, and a Gmail made just for this project hosts and sends all outgoing mail. User can input the email address to send the message to, and the message itself. Outgoing Email Address is testwillissa@gmail.com.




It's much simpler than that.
Just upload your image to the repository root, and link to the filename without any path, like so:
